# üîß Zoho Mailbox Troubleshooting

## üö® Problem: Email to hello@inspectionwale.com Not Delivered

**Error from Gmail:**
> "Message couldn't be delivered to hello@inspectionwale.com because the remote server is misconfigured"

---

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

Your DNS is correct (MX records point to Zoho), but Zoho's mail server is rejecting emails because:

**Possible Reasons:**
1. ‚úÖ Domain verified in Zoho, BUT mailbox not actually created
2. ‚úÖ Mailbox created but not activated
3. ‚úÖ Mailbox created in wrong domain/organization
4. ‚úÖ Zoho Mail not fully configured for custom domain

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Fix

### STEP 1: Verify Mailbox Actually Exists

1. **Login to Zoho Mail Admin**:
   - Go to: https://mailadmin.zoho.com/
   - Sign in with your Zoho account

2. **Check Users**:
   - Click **"Users"** in left menu
   - Look for: `hello@inspectionwale.com`
   - Look for: `no-reply@inspectionwale.com`

**What do you see?**
- ‚úÖ **Both emails listed** ‚Üí Go to Step 2
- ‚ùå **Not listed or shows @zoho.in** ‚Üí Go to Step 3

---

### STEP 2: Verify Mailbox Status

If mailboxes are listed, check their status:

1. Click on `hello@inspectionwale.com`
2. Check **Status**: Should be "Active" (not "Pending" or "Suspended")
3. If status is **Pending**:
   - Check the email for activation link
   - Or click **"Resend Activation Email"**

---

### STEP 3: Create Mailboxes Correctly

If mailboxes don't exist or show wrong domain:

1. In Zoho Admin, click **"Users"** ‚Üí **"Add User"**

2. **For hello@inspectionwale.com**:
   ```
   Email Address: hello
   Domain: inspectionwale.com (must be from dropdown)
   
   First Name: InspectionWale
   Last Name: Support
   
   Password: [create strong password - save it!]
   
   ‚úÖ Check: "Send activation email"
   ```

3. Click **"Add"**

4. **Repeat for no-reply@inspectionwale.com**:
   ```
   Email Address: no-reply
   Domain: inspectionwale.com
   First Name: InspectionWale
   Last Name: System
   Password: [create strong password]
   ```

5. Click **"Add"**

---

### STEP 4: Verify Domain Settings in Zoho

1. In Zoho Admin, click **"Domains"** in left menu
2. Click on **"inspectionwale.com"**
3. Check **Status**: Must be "Verified" ‚úÖ
4. Check **MX Records**: Must show "Configured" ‚úÖ

**If MX shows "Not Configured"**:
- Zoho hasn't detected the MX records yet
- Wait 10-15 minutes
- Click **"Verify MX Records"**

---

### STEP 5: Test Mailbox Login

**Try logging in directly:**

1. Go to: https://mail.zoho.com/
2. Enter: `hello@inspectionwale.com`
3. Enter password
4. Click **"Sign In"**

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ **Login successful** ‚Üí Mailbox works! Go to Step 6
- ‚ùå **"Account doesn't exist"** ‚Üí Mailbox not created, go back to Step 3
- ‚ùå **"Wrong password"** ‚Üí Reset password in Admin panel

---

### STEP 6: Send Test Email FROM Zoho

Once you can login:

1. In Zoho webmail, click **"Compose"**
2. To: `prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com`
3. Subject: `Test from hello@inspectionwale.com`
4. Body: `Testing Zoho Mail setup!`
5. Click **"Send"**
6. Check your Gmail - should arrive in 1-2 minutes

---

### STEP 7: Test Receiving Email Again

After confirming mailbox works:

1. From Gmail, send email to: `hello@inspectionwale.com`
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Check Zoho webmail: https://mail.zoho.com/
4. Email should appear in inbox!

## üîç Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Mailbox not found in dropdown"

**Fix:**
- Go to **"Domains"** ‚Üí Click "inspectionwale.com"
- Verify status is "Verified"
- If not verified, add TXT record again and wait

### Issue: "Can't create user - limit reached"

**Fix:**
- Free plan allows only 5 users
- Delete any test/unused accounts first
- Or upgrade to paid plan (not needed yet)

### Issue: "MX records not detected"

**Fix:**
Run this PowerShell command to check:
```powershell
nslookup -type=MX inspectionwale.com
```

Should show:
```
mx.zoho.com (priority 10)
mx2.zoho.com (priority 20)
mx3.zoho.com (priority 50)
```

If not showing:
- Wait 15-30 minutes (DNS propagation)
- Check Route 53 - records should be there
- Click "Verify MX" in Zoho again

## üéØ Alternative: Use Gmail for Now (Quick Workaround)

**If Zoho is taking too long to configure:**

You can proceed with Lambda deployment using Gmail:

1. In SES, verify: `prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com` (already done ‚úÖ)
2. Use this as `SES_FROM` in both Lambda functions
3. All emails will come from Gmail
4. Fix Zoho later when you have more time

**Lambda env var:**
```
SES_FROM=prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com
```

**Downside:** Not as professional, but works for testing!

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Before continuing to Lambda deployment:

**Option A: Zoho Mail Working**
- [ ] Can login to hello@inspectionwale.com in Zoho webmail
- [ ] Can send test email FROM hello@inspectionwale.com
- [ ] Can receive email TO hello@inspectionwale.com
- [ ] Use `SES_FROM=hello@inspectionwale.com` in Lambda

**Option B: Use Gmail Temporarily**

- [ ] Can send test email from SES Console
- [ ] Use `SES_FROM=prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com` in Lambda
- [ ] Fix Zoho later (not blocking Lambda deployment)
