### STEP 3: Configure Email Routing (MX Records) (10 minutes)

#### 3.1 Get MX Records from Zoho

Zoho will show you MX records to add. They look like:

```
Priority: 10
Host/Name: @
Value: mx.zoho.com
TTL: 3600

Priority: 20
Host/Name: @
Value: mx2.zoho.com
TTL: 3600

Priority: 50
Host/Name: @
Value: mx3.zoho.com
TTL: 3600
```

   10 mx.zoho.com
   20 mx2.zoho.com
   50 mx3.zoho.com
TTL: 300
Routing policy: Simple routing
```

**Note:** In Route 53, you add all MX records as separate lines in ONE record, each with format: `priority hostname`

5. Click **"Create records"**
6. You should see one MX record with 3 values listed

#### 3.3 Add SPF Record to Route 53 (Prevents Spam)

1. In Route 53 ‚Üí Hosted zones ‚Üí inspectionwale.com
2. Click **"Create record"**
3. Fill in:
   ```
   Record name: (leave blank for root domain)
   Record type: TXT
   Value: "v=spf1 include:zoho.com include:amazonses.com ~all"
          (include quotes - this allows both Zoho AND AWS SES to send)
   TTL: 300
   ```
4. Click **"Create records"**

**Note:** This SPF record includes BOTH Zoho and AWS SES, so emails from your website (via SES) and Zoho won't be marked as spam.

#### 3.4 Add DKIM Record to Route 53 (Email Authentication)

1. In Zoho Mail setup, go to **"Email Configuration"** ‚Üí **"DKIM"**
2. Zoho will generate a DKIM record like:

   TTL: 3600

     Record name: zoho._domainkey
     Record type: TXT

     TTL: 300
     ```
   - Click **"Create records"**

### STEP 5: Configure AWS SES with Zoho (15 minutes)

   Record type: CNAME
   Value: abc123.dkim.amazonses.com (replace with actual value from SES)
   TTL: 300 (or keep default)
   Routing policy: Simple routing

   TTL: 300
   ```
   Click **"Create records"**

5. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation
6. Go back to SES console and refresh - domain should show **"Verified"** ‚úÖ

#### 5.3 Verify Individual Email Addresses in SES

For sending emails via SES, verify these:

1. In SES console, click **"Verified identities"**
2. Click **"Create identity"**
3. Select **"Email address"**
4. Enter: `no-reply@inspectionwale.com`
5. Click **"Create identity"**

**Check email:**

4. Click verification link
5. ‚úÖ Email verified in SES!

**Repeat for:**
- `hello@inspectionwale.com`

---

### STEP 6: Update Lambda Environment Variables (When You Deploy Them)

**‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: You'll do this AFTER deploying the Lambda functions (Steps 3-4 of main E2E guide)**

#### 6.1 For customer-listings Lambda (when you update it)

When you update the customer-listings Lambda in Step 4:
- Set `SES_FROM` to: `hello@inspectionwale.com`

#### 6.2 For listing-approval Lambda (when you create it)

When you create the NEW listing-approval Lambda in Step 3:
- Set `SES_FROM` to: `no-reply@inspectionwale.com`

**You don't need to do this now!** Just remember:
- Use `hello@inspectionwale.com` or `no-reply@inspectionwale.com` 
- Both are verified in SES ‚úÖ
- Both will work perfectly with Zoho

---

### STEP 7: Setup Email Forwarding (Optional but Recommended)

If you want emails to `hello@inspectionwale.com` to also forward to Gmail:

#### 7.1 In Zoho Mail Admin

1. Go to **"Email Forwarding"** or **"Aliases"**
2. For `hello@inspectionwale.com`:
   - Click **"Forward"**
   - Add: `prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com`
   - Select: **"Keep copy in Zoho"** ‚úÖ
3. **Save**

Now emails to hello@inspectionwale.com will:
- Stay in Zoho inbox ‚úÖ
- Also forward to Gmail ‚úÖ

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Receiving

**Check:**
1. MX records added correctly? (Wait 1-2 hours for DNS propagation)
2. Old MX records removed?
3. Check Zoho Mail webmail - emails might be there
4. Check spam folder

### Emails Going to Spam

**Fix:**
1. Add SPF record (v=spf1 include:zoho.com include:amazonses.com ~all)
2. Verify DKIM in Zoho admin panel
3. Add DKIM records to DNS
4. Request production access in AWS SES
5. Warm up your domain (send gradually increasing emails)

### Can't Send from AWS SES

**Check:**
1. Domain verified in SES? (Green checkmark)
2. Email address verified in SES?
3. DKIM records added to DNS?
4. SES_FROM environment variable updated in Lambda?
5. Lambda has SES permissions?
6. Still in SES sandbox? (Verify recipient emails)

### DNS Changes Not Working

**Wait:**
- DNS propagation takes 15 minutes to 48 hours
- Most changes: 30 minutes to 2 hours
- Check propagation: https://dnschecker.org/
