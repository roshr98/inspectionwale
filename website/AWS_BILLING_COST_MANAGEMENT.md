## üîç Part 4: Monitor Free Tier Usage (5 minutes)

### Check Free Tier Limits

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/freetier

2. **Review these services carefully:**

   **S3 Storage (Most likely to exceed):**
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **5 GB** storage
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **20,000 GET** requests/month
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **2,000 PUT** requests/month
   
   **Your current usage:**
   - Bucket: `inspectionwale-car-listings`
   - Check size in S3 console
   
   **Lambda:**
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **1 million requests**/month
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **400,000 GB-seconds** compute time
   
   **DynamoDB:**
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **25 GB** storage
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **25 read/write units**
   
   **CloudFront (if using):**
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **1 TB** data transfer out
   - ‚úÖ Free tier: **10 million** requests

3. **Look for services showing orange/red:**
   - Orange = Approaching limit (80%+)
   - Red = Exceeded free tier

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Part 5: Analyze S3 Storage Costs

S3 is most likely to exceed free tier. Let's check:

### Check S3 Bucket Size

1. **Open S3 Console:** https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/

2. **Check `inspectionwale-car-listings` bucket:**
   - Click on bucket name
   - Go to **"Metrics"** tab
   - Look at **"Bucket size"** graph
   - Check **"Number of objects"**

3. **What to look for:**
   ```
   Total Size: ______ GB  (Free tier = 5 GB)
   Total Objects: ______ files
   ```

### S3 Storage Breakdown Commands

Run these AWS CLI commands to analyze storage:

```powershell
# Check total bucket size
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings --recursive --summarize --human-readable

# List largest files (top 20)
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings --recursive | Sort-Object -Property @{Expression={[int64]($_ -split '\s+')[2]}} -Descending | Select-Object -First 20

# Count files by folder
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/ --recursive | ForEach-Object { ($_ -split '\s+')[3].Split('/')[0] } | Group-Object | Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

### Understanding S3 Costs

**Pricing (after free tier):**
- Storage: **$0.023 per GB/month** (‚Çπ1.90/GB)
- GET requests: **$0.0004 per 1,000** requests
- PUT requests: **$0.005 per 1,000** requests

**Example cost calculation:**
```
If you have 10 GB of images:
- Free tier: 5 GB
- Charged: 5 GB
- Cost: 5 GB √ó $0.023 = $0.115/month (‚Çπ9.50)

If you have 50,000 GET requests:
- Free tier: 20,000
- Charged: 30,000
- Cost: (30,000 √∑ 1,000) √ó $0.0004 = $0.012/month (‚Çπ1)
```

---

## üìä Part 6: Simple Monthly Cost Report

### Get Last Month's Bill

```powershell
# Get current month costs by service (PowerShell)
aws ce get-cost-and-usage `
  --time-period Start=2025-10-01,End=2025-10-14 `
  --granularity MONTHLY `
  --metrics BlendedCost `
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE `
  --output table
```

This shows you **exactly which service is costing how much**.

### Example Report Output:
```
Service                          | Cost (USD)
---------------------------------|------------
Amazon Simple Storage Service    | $0.50
AWS Lambda                       | $0.15
Amazon DynamoDB                  | $0.00 (Free tier)
AWS Amplify                      | $0.00 (Free tier)
CloudFront                       | $0.00 (Free tier)
---------------------------------|------------
TOTAL                            | $0.65
```

## üö® Part 7: Cost Alert Email Examples

You'll receive emails like this:

### Email 1: Free Tier Warning
```
Subject: AWS Free Tier Usage Alert

You've used 82% of your free tier for:
- Service: Amazon S3
- Limit: 5 GB storage
- Current usage: 4.1 GB
- Days remaining: 15 days

Action: Consider deleting old customer listing photos.
```

### Email 2: Budget Alert
```
Subject: AWS Budget Alert - 80% Threshold

Your budget "InspectionWale-Monthly-Budget" has reached 80%.

Budget: $5.00/month
Current spend: $4.05
Forecasted spend: $5.50

Top services:
1. S3: $2.50 (62%)
2. Lambda: $1.00 (25%)
3. CloudFront: $0.55 (13%)

Action: Review S3 storage and consider cleanup.
```

---

## üßπ Part 8: Cost Cleanup Recommendations

### When S3 Exceeds Free Tier

**Option 1: Delete Old Customer Listings**
```powershell
# List all customer listing submissions older than 90 days
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/submissions/ --recursive | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -lt (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) }

# Delete old submissions (BE CAREFUL!)
# Only run this after reviewing the list above
aws s3 rm s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/submissions/OLD_SUBMISSION_ID/ --recursive
```

**Option 2: Enable S3 Lifecycle Policy (Auto-delete old files)**

1. Go to S3 bucket ‚Üí **Management** ‚Üí **Lifecycle rules**
2. Create rule:
   - Name: `Delete old submissions`
   - Prefix: `submissions/`
   - Delete objects after: **90 days**
   - Delete incomplete uploads: **7 days**

**Option 3: Compress Images Further**
- Use AWS Lambda to automatically compress uploaded images
- Convert JPEG to WebP/AVIF (70% smaller)

### When Lambda Exceeds Free Tier

**Check Lambda invocations:**
```powershell
aws cloudwatch get-metric-statistics `
  --namespace AWS/Lambda `
  --metric-name Invocations `
  --dimensions Name=FunctionName,Value=customerListings `
  --start-time 2025-10-01T00:00:00Z `
  --end-time 2025-10-14T23:59:59Z `
  --period 86400 `
  --statistics Sum
```

**Reduce Lambda costs:**
1. Check for infinite loops or errors causing re-execution
2. Optimize Lambda memory (reduce from 512 MB to 256 MB)
3. Set reserved concurrency limit (prevent runaway costs)

---

## üìã Part 9: Daily Cost Monitoring Routine

### Every Monday Morning (5 minutes):

1. **Check AWS Billing Dashboard:**
   - URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bills
   - Look at **"Month-to-date balance"**

2. **Review Free Tier Usage:**
   - URL: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/freetier
   - Check S3, Lambda, DynamoDB

3. **Run Cost Report:**
```powershell
# Quick cost check
aws ce get-cost-and-usage `
  --time-period Start=2025-10-01,End=2025-10-14 `
  --granularity MONTHLY `
  --metrics BlendedCost `
  --output table
```

---

## üéØ Part 10: Decision Matrix

Use this simple chart to decide what to do:

| Monthly Cost | Action Required |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **$0 - $1** | ‚úÖ **No action** - You're well within free tier |
| **$1 - $3** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Monitor** - Check which service is causing it |
| **$3 - $5** | üîç **Investigate** - Review S3 storage, consider cleanup |
| **$5 - $10** | üö® **Act now** - Delete old files, optimize images |
| **$10+** | üî¥ **URGENT** - Something is wrong, check for errors |

### Cost-Benefit Analysis:

**Current Services:**
```
Service          | Free Tier | Typical Usage | Risk Level
-----------------|-----------|---------------|------------
S3 Storage       | 5 GB      | 2-3 GB        | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM
Lambda           | 1M reqs   | 10k reqs      | ‚úÖ LOW
DynamoDB         | 25 GB     | 0.5 GB        | ‚úÖ LOW
Amplify Hosting  | 15 GB     | 2 GB          | ‚úÖ LOW
CloudFront       | 1 TB      | 10 GB         | ‚úÖ LOW
SES (Email)      | 3k emails | 100 emails    | ‚úÖ LOW
```

**Most likely to exceed:** S3 Storage (customer listing photos)

## üéì Part 14: Understanding Your AWS Bill

### Bill Components:

**1. Service Charges:**
- What you pay for actual usage (storage, compute, data transfer)

**2. Data Transfer:**
- OUT to internet: Usually charged
- IN from internet: Usually free
- Between AWS services in same region: Usually free

**3. Requests:**
- API calls to services (S3 GET, PUT, Lambda invocations)

### Reading Your Monthly Bill:

```
Service: Amazon S3
  Storage: $0.50
    - Standard Storage: 7 GB √ó $0.023 = $0.16
    - Exceeded free tier: 2 GB
  Requests: $0.01
    - GET requests: 25,000 (5,000 over free tier)
  Data Transfer: $0.00 (within free tier)
  
Total S3: $0.51
```

## üí° Part 15: Cost Optimization Tips

### Immediate Actions (Free):
1. ‚úÖ Enable S3 Intelligent-Tiering (auto-moves old files to cheaper storage)
2. ‚úÖ Delete failed/incomplete S3 uploads (can accumulate)
3. ‚úÖ Compress customer listing images before upload
4. ‚úÖ Set Lambda timeout to minimum needed (reduce wasted compute)
5. ‚úÖ Enable CloudWatch Logs retention (7 days instead of forever)

### Future Optimizations:
1. Use CloudFront CDN (reduces S3 GET requests)
2. Implement image lazy loading (reduces data transfer)
3. Use WebP/AVIF format (70% smaller than JPEG)
4. Archive old customer listings to S3 Glacier (90% cheaper)

---

## üÜò Part 16: What To Do If Costs Spike

### Step 1: Identify the Problem
```powershell
# Get yesterday's costs by service
aws ce get-cost-and-usage `
  --time-period Start=2025-10-13,End=2025-10-14 `
  --granularity DAILY `
  --metrics BlendedCost `
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE
```

### Step 2: Check for Common Issues

**S3 Cost Spike:**
- Someone uploaded many large files
- Misconfigured app uploading in loop
- Check CloudWatch Logs for errors

**Lambda Cost Spike:**
- Function stuck in infinite loop
- Error causing automatic retries
- Check CloudWatch Logs for the function

**Data Transfer Spike:**
- DDoS attack or bot scraping
- Check CloudFront access logs
- Enable AWS WAF if needed

### Step 3: Emergency Cost Control

**Stop All Spending (Nuclear Option):**
1. Disable Lambda functions (Configuration ‚Üí Concurrency ‚Üí Set to 0)
2. Set S3 bucket to private (Block all public access)
3. Contact AWS Support

**Safer Options:**
1. Set Lambda reserved concurrency to 10 (limits parallel executions)
2. Enable S3 request throttling
3. Review and delete unnecessary files
