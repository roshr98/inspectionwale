## 🚀 Deploy in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Push to Git (2 minutes)

git add .
git commit -m "Add C2C Marketplace with inquiry form"

```
**AWS Amplify will auto-deploy in 2-3 minutes!**

### Step 2: Deploy Lambda Function (5 minutes)

**Option A - Quick Deploy via AWS Console:**

1. **Package the function:**
   ```powershell
   cd amplify\functions\c2c-inquiry
   npm install
   Compress-Archive -Path .\* -DestinationPath ..\c2c-inquiry.zip -Force
   cd ..\..\..
   ```

2. **Create Lambda in AWS Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda
   - Click "Create function"
   - Name: `inspectionwale-c2c-inquiry`
   - Runtime: Node.js 18.x
   - Upload `c2c-inquiry.zip`

3. **Create Function URL:**
   - Configuration → Function URL → Create
   - Auth: NONE
   - CORS: Enable, Allow `*`, Methods: `POST, OPTIONS`
   - **Copy the URL**

4. **Add SES Permission:**
   - Configuration → Permissions → Role
   - Add policy: `AmazonSESFullAccess`

### Step 3: Update Lambda URL (1 minute)

Edit `C2C_Marketplace.html` line ~440:
```javascript
// Change this:
const res = await fetch('/api/c2cInquiry', {

// To your Lambda URL:
const res = await fetch('https://YOUR-LAMBDA-URL-HERE.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/', {
```

```powershell
git add C2C_Marketplace.html
