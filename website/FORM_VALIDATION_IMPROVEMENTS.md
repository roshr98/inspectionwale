## Code Quality

### ‚úÖ Best Practices Followed
- Async/await for cleaner promise handling
- Proper error catching at each stage
- User-friendly error messages (no technical jargon)
- Accessibility: Focus management and ARIA labels
- Smooth scroll with `behavior: 'smooth'`
- Timeout for focus after scroll completes
- Cleanup of object URLs to prevent memory leaks
- Modal backdrop cleanup to prevent UI bugs

### ‚úÖ Security
- CSP updated to allow S3 presigned URLs
- Content-Type validation for uploads
- Server-side validation (Lambda handles final checks)
- RC document never published (backend logic)

### ‚úÖ Performance
- Object URLs used for previews (no base64)
- URLs revoked when photos cleared
- Only selected photos uploaded (no unnecessary uploads)
- Presigned URLs used for direct S3 upload (no Lambda data limit)

## Deployment Steps

1. Save all changes to `index.html` and `js/main.js`
2. Commit changes:
   ```bash
   git add index.html js/main.js
   git commit -m "Improve form validation: RC optional, better messages, auto-scroll"
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for AWS Amplify deployment
5. Test the live site thoroughly using the checklist above

## Notes

- RC document is optional but still stored if provided
- All 6 required photos must be uploaded for submission
- Form validation happens client-side first, then server-side
- Photos upload directly to S3 using presigned URLs (no Lambda size limits)
- Success confirmation shows via both alert box and browser popup
