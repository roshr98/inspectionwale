3. **Colorful footer icons:**

- ❌ Gray footer icons
- ❌ Unicode star characters (★)
- ❌ Single column layout
- ❌ Border lines between rows

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If OLD design still shows:

1. **Check Lambda timestamp:**
   - AWS Lambda Console → Function details
   - "Last modified" should be recent (today)

2. **Wait a bit:**
   - Lambda can take 1-2 minutes to fully deploy
   - Try generating report again after 2 minutes

3. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press: `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
   - Clear cached images and files
   - Or use incognito/private window

4. **Check CloudWatch Logs:**
   - AWS Lambda Console → Monitor tab → View logs in CloudWatch
   - Look for any errors in recent logs

5. **Re-upload ZIP:**
   - Maybe upload didn't complete
   - Try uploading `lambda-final-design.zip` again

### If download doesn't work:
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Look for red error messages
- Check that form submitted successfully (green success message)

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

### ✅ All of these should work:
1. Form submits successfully
2. PDF downloads automatically
3. No popup blocking download
4. PDF opens correctly
5. **Light blue background visible**
6. **2-column vehicle details layout**
7. **Colorful footer icons**
8. **Golden star shapes**
