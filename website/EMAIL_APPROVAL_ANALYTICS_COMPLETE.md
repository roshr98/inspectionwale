# ðŸš€ Complete Email Approval & Analytics Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide covers the complete implementation of:
1. âœ… Email-based listing approval/rejection workflow
2. âœ… Duplicate seller prevention (one listing per email/mobile)
3. âœ… Google Analytics 4 tracking
4. âœ… Enhanced seller data in DynamoDB

---

## Part 1: DynamoDB Schema Updates

### Changes Made
Added three new top-level fields to `CarListingsTable`:
- `sellerName` (String) - For querying by seller name
- `sellerEmail` (String) - For duplicate detection
- `sellerMobile` (String) - For duplicate detection

### Why Top-Level Fields?
- **Performance**: Direct attribute access vs nested object queries
- **Indexing**: Can create GSI (Global Secondary Index) on these fields
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Efficient scanning for existing sellers
- **Cost Optimization**: Faster queries = lower DynamoDB read costs

### No Manual Schema Changes Needed!
âœ… DynamoDB is schemaless - new fields will be automatically added when first listing is submitted
âœ… Backward compatible - existing listings will continue to work

---

## Part 2: Duplicate Seller Prevention

### How It Works
```javascript
// Before creating listing, check for duplicates
1. Scan DynamoDB for approved listings
2. Filter by sellerEmail OR sellerMobile
3. If match found â†’ reject with error message
4. If no match â†’ proceed with listing creation
```

### Error Message Shown to User
```
"A listing already exists with this email/mobile number. 
Only one active listing per seller is allowed. 
Contact support if you need assistance."
```

### Performance Considerations
- Uses **FilterExpression** to check both email and mobile in single scan
- Only scans listings with `status = 'approved'`
- Duplicate check failure doesn't block submission (graceful fallback)
- For high volume, consider creating GSI on sellerEmail and sellerMobile

---

## Part 3: Email Approval Workflow

### Architecture
```
User Submits Listing
      â†“
Lambda: customer-listings
      â†“
Save to DynamoDB (status: pending)
      â†“
Send Email via SES with Approve/Reject Buttons
      â†“
Admin Clicks Button in Email
      â†“
Lambda: listing-approval
      â†“
Update DynamoDB (status: approved/rejected)
      â†“
Send Confirmation Email to Seller
      â†“
If Approved: Listing appears on website
```

### Email Features
âœ… Beautiful HTML design with gradient header  
âœ… Complete car details (make, model, year, kms, price)  
âœ… Seller information (name, mobile, email)  
âœ… Photo gallery with all uploaded images  
âœ… Large, prominent Approve/Reject buttons  
âœ… Secure tokens (valid for 7 days)  
âœ… Prevents double-processing (checks if already processed)  

### Security
- **HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens** - prevents tampering
- **Timestamp validation** - 7-day expiry
- **One-time processing** - cannot approve/reject twice
- **Base64URL encoding** - URL-safe tokens

        "ses:SendEmail",
        "ses:SendRawEmail"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

---

### Step 2: Update customer-listings Lambda

#### 2.1 Update Environment Variables
Add these to existing customer-listings Lambda:
```
APPROVAL_SECRET_KEY = SAME_AS_LISTING_APPROVAL_LAMBDA
APPROVAL_URL = https://YOUR_LISTING_APPROVAL_FUNCTION_URL.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws
```

#### 2.2 Package and Deploy
```powershell
cd c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Inpectionwale\website\amplify\functions\customer-listings\src

## Part 9: Troubleshooting

### Issue: Not Receiving Emails
**Check**:
1. SES is out of sandbox mode (or recipient is verified)
2. SES_FROM email is verified in SES console
3. Lambda has SES permissions in IAM role
4. Check CloudWatch logs for SES errors
5. Check spam folder

**Solution**:
```powershell
# Test SES from AWS CLI
aws ses send-email `
  --from hello@inspectionwale.com `
  --destination ToAddresses=your@email.com `
  --message Subject={Data="Test"},Body={Text={Data="Test email"}} `
  --region us-east-1
```

### Issue: Approve/Reject Links Don't Work
**Check**:
1. Function URL is public (Auth type: NONE)
2. SECRET_KEY matches in both Lambdas
3. Token is not expired (< 7 days)
4. Lambda has DynamoDB permissions

**Solution**:
- Check CloudWatch logs for listing-approval Lambda
- Look for "Token verification error" or "DynamoDB error"

### Issue: Duplicate Check Not Working
**Check**:
1. sellerEmail and sellerMobile fields are being saved
2. Check DynamoDB table to verify fields exist
3. Review CloudWatch logs for scan errors

**Solution**:
```javascript
// In customer-listings Lambda, add debug logging:
console.log('Checking duplicates for:', sellerEmail, sellerMobile)
console.log('Duplicate check result:', duplicateCheck)
```

### Issue: GA4 Not Tracking
**Check**:
1. Measurement ID is correct (not placeholder)
2. index.html changes deployed to Amplify
3. Script not blocked by ad blocker
4. Check browser console for errors

**Solution**:
```javascript
// Test in browser console:
gtag('event', 'test_event', { test_param: 'test_value' })
// Then check GA4 Realtime report for "test_event"
```
