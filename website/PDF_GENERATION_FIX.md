# PDF Generation Fix - NaN Error Resolution

## Issue Summary
**Date:** 2024
**Commit:** df5d653
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### Problem Description
Lambda function was successfully uploading all 48 inspection photos to S3, but crashing during PDF generation with the following error:

```
Error: unsupported number: NaN
    at PDFDocument.roundedRect (/var/task/index.js:567:11)
    at generatePDF (/var/task/index.js:67:10)
```

### Root Cause
The code was using `'auto'` as the height parameter in `doc.roundedRect()` calls, which PDFKit does not support. PDFKit requires numeric values for all rectangle dimensions (x, y, width, height, radius).

**Example of the bug:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - 'auto' causes NaN error
doc.roundedRect(50, yPos, 505, 'auto', 5)
```

### Solution
Pre-calculate the height using `doc.heightOfString()` before calling `roundedRect()`, then pass the numeric value:

**Fixed code:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Calculate height first
const notesHeight = doc.heightOfString(data.interiorNotes, { width: 485 });
doc.roundedRect(50, yPos, 505, notesHeight + 40, 5)
```

### Files Modified
- `amplify/functions/generate-report/src/index.js`

### Changes Made
Fixed **8 instances** of `roundedRect()` calls with `'auto'` parameter:

1. **Line 467** - exteriorNotes section
2. **Line 567** - interiorNotes section (original error location)
3. **Line 673** - engineNotes section
4. **Line 761** - tiresNotes section
5. **Line 815** - testDriveNotes section
6. **Line 877** - structureNotes section
7. **Line 924** - issuesFound section
8. **Line 945** - recommendations section

### Technical Details

#### Before (Broken):
```javascript
if (data.interiorNotes) {
  yPos = checkNewPage(yPos, 60);
  doc.roundedRect(50, yPos, 505, 'auto', 5)  // ❌ NaN error
     .fillColor('#f5f5f5');
  
  doc.fillColor(colors.text)
     .fontSize(9)
     .font('Helvetica')
     .text(data.interiorNotes, 60, yPos + 25, { 
       width: 485,
       align: 'justify'
     });
  
  yPos += doc.heightOfString(data.interiorNotes, { width: 485 }) + 45;
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```javascript
if (data.interiorNotes) {
  yPos = checkNewPage(yPos, 60);
  const notesHeight = doc.heightOfString(data.interiorNotes, { width: 485 });  // ✅ Calculate first
  doc.roundedRect(50, yPos, 505, notesHeight + 40, 5)  // ✅ Use calculated height
     .fillColor('#f5f5f5');
  
  doc.fillColor(colors.text)
     .fontSize(9)
     .font('Helvetica')
     .text(data.interiorNotes, 60, yPos + 25, { 
       width: 485,
       align: 'justify'
     });
  
  yPos += notesHeight + 45;  // ✅ Reuse calculated height
}
```

### Verification Steps

1. **Check CloudWatch Logs** after deployment:
   ```
   ✅ Content-Type: multipart/form-data
   ✅ Files count: 48
   ✅ Uploaded 48 images successfully
   ✅ Generating PDF with 48 embedded images...
   ✅ PDF generated successfully  <-- Should see this now!
   ✅ Response Status: 200
   ```

2. **Test with inspector form:**
   - Submit inspection with all 48 photos
   - Verify PDF downloads successfully
   - Check that notes sections display properly in PDF

3. **Verify S3 uploads:**
   - Check `inspectionwale-reports` bucket
   - Confirm PDF file exists with correct filename format
   - Download and verify PDF opens without errors

### Why This Happened

The `'auto'` string was likely intended as a placeholder or copied from CSS-like syntax, but:
- PDFKit is a low-level PDF generation library
- It requires explicit numeric coordinates for all drawing operations
- When PDFKit tried to parse `'auto'` as a number, it resulted in `NaN`
- The `NaN` value then caused the crash at the `roundedRect` method

### Impact

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ All form submissions failed during PDF generation
- ❌ Lambda returned 500 errors
- ✅ Photos uploaded successfully (but wasted since PDF failed)

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Photos upload successfully (48 images)
- ✅ PDF generates with all sections and photos
- ✅ Lambda returns 200 OK
- ✅ Users receive download link for PDF

### Related Issues

This fix is separate from the earlier Lambda URL issue:
- **Previous issue:** Wrong Lambda URL in form (403 errors)
- **This issue:** PDF generation crash after successful upload

Both issues have now been resolved.

### Deployment

Deployed via AWS Amplify auto-deployment:
- Branch: `main`
- Commit: `df5d653`
- Function: `generate-report`
- Region: `us-east-1`

Expected deployment time: 2-5 minutes after push to GitHub.

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Wait for Amplify deployment to complete
- [ ] Submit test inspection with 48 photos
- [ ] Verify CloudWatch shows "PDF generated successfully"
- [ ] Confirm PDF downloads
- [ ] Open PDF and check all sections render correctly
- [ ] Verify notes sections have proper background boxes
- [ ] Check that all 48 photos appear in PDF

### Performance Note

The calculation of `heightOfString()` before rendering is actually MORE efficient than trying to use `'auto'`, because:
1. We were already calculating it for `yPos` updates
2. Now we reuse the same value instead of calculating twice
3. No performance degradation from this fix

**Status:** Ready for production testing
**Next Steps:** Monitor CloudWatch logs after next inspection submission
