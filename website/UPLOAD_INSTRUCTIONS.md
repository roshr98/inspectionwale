## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If you still see OLD design:

1. **Check Lambda "Last modified":**
   - Should show current date/time
   - If old, upload may have failed

2. **Wait 1-2 minutes:**
   - AWS Lambda needs time to deploy
   - Clear browser cache again

3. **Check CloudWatch logs:**
   - AWS Lambda → Monitor → View logs
   - Should show: "📄 Starting PDF generation..."
   - Look for errors

4. **Try different browser:**
   - Test in incognito/private mode
   - Ensures no cache issues

### If upload fails:

1. **Check AWS permissions:**
   - You need Lambda update permissions
   - Contact AWS admin if needed

2. **Try uploading via S3:**
   - Upload ZIP to S3 bucket first
   - Then deploy from S3 URL

3. **Check function name:**
   - Make sure you're updating correct function
   - Check Amplify console for exact name

1. ✅ **Upload successful?**
