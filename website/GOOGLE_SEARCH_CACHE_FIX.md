# Google Search Cache Fix - Under Maintenance Message

## Problem
Google search results showing old "Under Maintenance" message even though website is now live with full functionality.

**Root Cause**: Google has cached the old meta description and title from your maintenance page. This is stored in Google's index and needs to be refreshed.

---

## ‚úÖ Current Status (CORRECT)

Your current meta tags in `index.html` are perfect:

```html
<title>InspectionWale - Pre-Purchase Car Inspection Services in Delhi NCR | 160+ Point Check</title>
<meta name="description" content="Expert pre-purchase car inspection services in Delhi NCR. 160+ point inspection, same-day reports, unbiased evaluation. Book online inspection for used cars. Trusted by 1000+ buyers.">
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
```

The issue is NOT with your website - it's with Google's cached snapshot.
