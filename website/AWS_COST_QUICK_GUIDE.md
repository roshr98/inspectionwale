## üßπ How to Reduce Costs

### Option 1: Delete Old Customer Listings (Saves most money)

**Check what's using space:**
```powershell
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings --recursive --summarize --human-readable
```

**Delete submissions older than 90 days:**
```powershell
# First, LIST what will be deleted (SAFE)
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/submissions/ --recursive | Select-Object -First 10

# Then DELETE (BE CAREFUL!)
aws s3 rm s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/submissions/OLD_ID/ --recursive
```

### Option 2: Enable Auto-Delete (Automatic cleanup)

1. Go to S3: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Click bucket ‚Üí **Management** ‚Üí **Lifecycle rules**
3. Create rule:
   ```
   Name: Auto-delete old submissions
   Prefix: submissions/
   Delete after: 90 days
   ```
4. Save

**Result:** Old customer listings automatically deleted after 90 days.

### Option 3: Compress Images (Reduces storage)

Your images are already compressed with AVIF format! No action needed.

## üìÖ Monthly Routine (5 minutes)

### Every Monday Morning:

**1. Run cost report:**
```powershell
.\check-aws-costs.ps1
```

**2. Check these 3 pages:**
- Bills: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/bills
- Free Tier: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/freetier
- Budgets: https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home#/budgets

**3. Look for:**
- ‚úÖ Total cost < $5
- ‚úÖ S3 storage < 5 GB
- ‚úÖ No services in "red" on Free Tier page

**4. Take action if needed:**
- Delete old customer listings
- Check for errors in Lambda logs
- Review unusual traffic spikes

---

## üÜò Emergency: Costs Suddenly Spike

### If you wake up to a $50 bill:

**Step 1: STOP THE BLEEDING (5 min)**

1. **Check what's causing it:**
```powershell
.\check-aws-costs.ps1
```

2. **Disable expensive service:**

For Lambda:
```powershell
aws lambda put-function-concurrency --function-name customerListings --reserved-concurrent-executions 0
```

For S3:
- Go to S3 Console
- Block all public access
- Enable request throttling

**Step 2: INVESTIGATE (10 min)**

Check CloudWatch Logs:
```powershell
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/customerListings --follow --since 1h
```

Look for:
- Infinite loops
- Error messages repeating
- Unusual traffic patterns

**Step 3: FIX & RE-ENABLE (varies)**

- Fix the bug causing high costs
- Re-enable service with limits
- Monitor closely for 24 hours

**Step 4: CONTACT AWS SUPPORT**

If costs are due to error/attack:
- https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/
- Request billing review (they often credit back erroneous charges)
