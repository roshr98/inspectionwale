# 🐛 Bug Fix: Lambda URL & Photo Upload Issue

## Problem Identified

### Issue 1: Wrong Lambda URL (403 Forbidden) ❌
**Form was calling**: `https://46kj4yz4qy7q7uuvgbfr6nz2uy0qxdiz.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/`

**Correct Lambda**: `https://mfy5ajp4e5lggmqypfbco34dd40ugreq.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/`

**Result**: Browser got `403 Forbidden` - wrong Lambda function URL

### Issue 2: Form Sending JSON Instead of FormData ❌
From CloudWatch logs:
```
Content-Type: application/json  ← Should be multipart/form-data
photos: {}                      ← Empty, no files
Files count: 0                  ← No files received
```

**Root Cause**: Old form was still deployed on website (hadn't been updated by Amplify yet)

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Updated Lambda URL
Changed in `inspector-form.html` line 1137:
```javascript
// OLD (wrong)
const response = await fetch('https://46kj4yz4qy7q7uuvgbfr6nz2uy0qxdiz.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/', {

// NEW (correct)
const response = await fetch('https://mfy5ajp4e5lggmqypfbco34dd40ugreq.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/', {
```

### 2. Pushed to GitHub
```
Commit: 6ca01c9
Message: "fix: Update Lambda URL to correct endpoint for photo uploads"
Status: Pushed successfully ✅
```

### 3. AWS Amplify Auto-Deployment Triggered
- Amplify will detect the new commit
- Build and deploy updated form
- ETA: 3-5 minutes

---

## 📊 CloudWatch Analysis

The Lambda function IS working correctly:
```
✅ Report generated successfully
✅ PDF uploaded to S3
✅ DynamoDB record saved
✅ Duration: ~400ms (well under timeout)
✅ Memory: 137MB / 511MB (sufficient)
```

**The Lambda code is fine!** The problem was:
1. Form calling wrong URL
2. Old form version still deployed (without photo fields)

## ⏳ What's Happening Now

### 1. Amplify is Building (Right Now)
- Check: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify
- Status: Should show "Building..." or "Deploying..."
- Time: ~3-5 minutes

### 2. Form Will Be Updated
Once deployed:
- ✅ Correct Lambda URL
- ✅ FormData with photo uploads
- ✅ 48 photo upload fields visible
- ✅ Image compression working

---

## 🧪 How to Test (After Amplify Finishes)

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
Check Amplify console until you see: **"Deployment successful"** ✅

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache (IMPORTANT!)
```
Option 1: Hard Refresh
- Windows: Ctrl + Shift + R
- Mac: Cmd + Shift + R

Option 2: Clear Cache
- Chrome: Settings → Privacy → Clear browsing data
- Select "Cached images and files"
- Clear data
```

### Step 3: Test the Form
1. Go to: https://www.inspectionwale.com/inspector-form.html
2. **Check page source** (Ctrl+U):
   - Search for: `mfy5ajp4e5lggmqypfbco34dd40ugreq`
   - If found: ✅ New version deployed
   - If not found: Wait longer or clear cache again

3. **Login**: inspector1 / Google@123455

4. **Look for photo upload fields**:
   - Should see 48 photo upload sections
   - Each with preview area
   - "Required" red asterisk

5. **Upload ONE test photo** (don't upload all 48 yet):
   - Upload to "RC Book" field only
   - Check preview appears
   - Submit form

6. **Check browser console** (F12):
   - Should NOT see 403 error
   - Should see progress bar
   - Should get success message

## 🔍 Verify It's Fixed

### In Browser Network Tab (F12 → Network):
**Before Fix**:
```
Request URL: https://46kj4yz4qy7q7uuvgbfr6nz2uy0qxdiz.lambda-url...
Status: 403 Forbidden ❌
Content-Type: application/json ❌
```

**After Fix** (expected):
```
Request URL: https://mfy5ajp4e5lggmqypfbco34dd40ugreq.lambda-url...
Status: 200 OK ✅
Content-Type: multipart/form-data ✅
```

### In CloudWatch Logs:
**Before Fix**:
```
Content-Type: application/json ❌
Files count: 0 ❌
photos: {} ❌
```

**After Fix** (expected):
```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data ✅
Files count: 1 (or more) ✅
Processing image: rcBook.jpg ✅
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working After Deployment

### Check 1: Is New Version Deployed?
```powershell
# PowerShell - Check file timestamp
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://www.inspectionwale.com/inspector-form.html" -Method HEAD | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Headers

# Or check in browser
# View source → Search for: "mfy5ajp4e5lggmqypfbco34dd40ugreq"
```

### Check 2: Clear Browser Cache Again
- Chrome: chrome://settings/clearBrowserData
- Select "Cached images and files" only
- Time range: "All time"
- Clear data
- Close and reopen browser

### Check 3: Try Incognito Mode
- Open new incognito/private window
- Go to: https://www.inspectionwale.com/inspector-form.html
- If it works here: Cache issue, keep clearing
- If still broken: Deployment issue, check Amplify

### Check 4: Verify Amplify Deployment
```
AWS Console → Amplify → inspectionwale
- Should show "Deployed" status
- Check deployment logs for errors
- Verify branch is "main"
```

## 🎯 Root Cause Summary

**The updated code with photo uploads WAS pushed to GitHub earlier**, but:
1. ❌ Lambda URL was wrong in the form
2. ❌ You tested before Amplify finished deploying
3. ❌ Browser cached the old form version

**Now fixed**:
1. ✅ Lambda URL corrected
2. ✅ Pushed to GitHub (commit 6ca01c9)
3. ✅ Amplify deploying now
4. ⏳ Waiting for deployment + cache clear

---

## 💡 Pro Tip: How to Avoid This

Always check these when testing:
1. **Amplify deployment status** before testing
2. **Hard refresh** browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **View source** to verify new code is deployed
4. **Network tab** to see actual requests
5. **CloudWatch logs** to see Lambda receiving data

---

## 📞 Current Status

✅ **Fix committed and pushed**
⏳ **Amplify is deploying** (check console)
⏳ **Wait 3-5 minutes** for deployment
🎯 **Then test with cache clear**

**ETA: Ready to test in ~5 minutes!**
