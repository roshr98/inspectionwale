# 🚀 Quick Deployment Checklist

## Overview
This is your step-by-step checklist to deploy all the new features we just implemented.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites (Do These First)

### 1. Generate Secret Key
```powershell
# Run this in PowerShell to generate a secure random key
-join ((48..57) + (65..90) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 32 | ForEach-Object {[char]$_})
```
**Copy the output - you'll need it for both Lambdas!**

### 2. Get Google Analytics Measurement ID
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Create new property: "InspectionWale"
3. Create web data stream
4. Copy Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

**Only if you want to send emails to unverified addresses**:
1. SES Console → Account dashboard
2. "Request production access"
3. Fill form: Use case = Transactional emails
4. Submit (takes 24-48 hours for approval)

**For testing**: Just verify the emails you want to send to!

---

## 📊 Part 4: Setup Google Analytics (Migrate from WhizzCheck)

### Important: You Already Have Google Analytics!
Since you're using WhizzCheck's Google account (prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com), you can **rename the existing property** instead of creating a new one. This preserves all historical data!

### Step 1: Update Existing GA4 Property (Recommended)
**Login and Find Your Property:**
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Login with: **prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com**
3. You should see "WhizzCheck" property in the dropdown (top-left)
4. Click the property name dropdown

**Rename Property:**
5. Click "Admin" (gear icon, bottom-left)
6. Under "Property" column → Click "Property settings"
7. Change:
   - **Property name**: `WhizzCheck` → `InspectionWale` (or keep both: "WhizzCheck / InspectionWale")
   - **Property details**: Update description to mention both domains
8. Click "Save"

**Update Data Stream:**
9. Still in Admin → Under Property column → Click "Data streams"
10. Click on your existing web data stream (likely named "WhizzCheck")
11. Update:
    - **Stream name**: `InspectionWale Website`
    - **Stream URL**: `https://www.inspectionwale.com`
12. Click "Save"

**Add InspectionWale as Additional Domain:**
13. In the same Data stream settings → Scroll down
14. Click "Configure tag settings" (if available)
15. Add cross-domain tracking if both sites are active

**Important: Keep the Same Measurement ID!**
- Do NOT create a new data stream
- Your existing Measurement ID (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`) will continue working
- Both WhizzCheck and InspectionWale can use the SAME Measurement ID
- All historical data is preserved

### Step 2: Get Your Measurement ID
1. Still in "Data streams" page
2. Click on your stream name
3. Top-right, you'll see **Measurement ID**: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`
4. **Copy this ID** - you'll need it for the next step
5. Example: `G-ABC123XYZ4`

### Step 3: Update index.html with Your Measurement ID
1. Open: `c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Inpectionwale\website\index.html`
2. Find line 48 (in `<head>` section):
   ```html
   <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
   ```
3. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID
4. Find line 54:
   ```javascript
   gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {
   ```
5. Replace `G-XXXXXXXXXX` with your actual Measurement ID
6. Save file

**Example After Replacement:**
```html
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-ABC123XYZ4"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  
  gtag('config', 'G-ABC123XYZ4', {
    'send_page_view': true,
    'page_title': document.title,
    'page_location': window.location.href
  });
  ...
</script>
```

### Step 4: Commit and Deploy Changes
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Inpectionwale\website"
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add Google Analytics tracking for InspectionWale"
git push origin main
```

Wait 2-3 minutes for AWS Amplify to auto-deploy.

### Step 5: Verify GA4 is Working
**Check Script Loading:**
1. Go to: https://www.inspectionwale.com
2. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
3. Go to "Network" tab
4. Reload page (Ctrl+R)
5. Filter by: `google-analytics` or `gtag`
6. You should see requests to:
   - `https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX`
   - `https://www.google-analytics.com/g/collect`
7. If you see these → Script is loading correctly! ✅

**Check Real-Time Data:**
1. Go back to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Click on "InspectionWale" property (or your renamed property)
3. Left sidebar → Reports → Realtime
4. Keep this tab open
5. Open https://www.inspectionwale.com in another tab/window
6. Navigate around the site (click listings, etc.)
7. Within 30-60 seconds, you should see:
   - **"1 user"** in the Realtime report
   - Your location on the map
   - Page views being tracked
   - Events firing (view_listing, etc.)
8. If you see yourself → GA4 is working perfectly! ✅

### Step 6: Optional - Keep WhizzCheck Tracking Too
**If WhizzCheck.com is still active and you want to track both sites:**

1. Keep the SAME Measurement ID in both sites
2. GA4 will automatically separate data by hostname
3. In GA4 Reports, you can filter by:
   - **Page location** → Contains "inspectionwale.com"
   - **Page location** → Contains "whizzcheck.com"

**OR create separate data streams:**
1. Admin → Data streams → "Add stream"
2. Create new stream for InspectionWale
3. Use different Measurement ID for each site
4. This gives completely separate reporting

**Recommendation**: Use the SAME ID for both sites initially, then analyze combined data. You can always split later if needed.

### Step 7: Update Google Places API (Reviews)
**Since you're using WhizzCheck's Places API for reviews:**

**Option A: Keep Using WhizzCheck's API Key (Easiest)**
- No changes needed
- Reviews will continue working
- API key is domain-agnostic (works on any domain you authorize)

**Option B: Create New InspectionWale API Key**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Login with: prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com
3. Select your existing project (or create new "InspectionWale")
4. APIs & Services → Credentials
5. Create new API key
6. Restrict to "Places API"
7. Add authorized domains:
   - `inspectionwale.com`
   - `www.inspectionwale.com`
8. Update API key in your website code

**Option C: Add InspectionWale to Existing API Key (Recommended)**
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. APIs & Services → Credentials
3. Find your existing API key (used for WhizzCheck)
4. Click "Edit" (pencil icon)
5. Under "Website restrictions" → Add:
   - `inspectionwale.com/*`
   - `www.inspectionwale.com/*`
6. Keep existing WhizzCheck domains too
7. Click "Save"

This way, the SAME API key works for both sites!
