## 🚨 Important Notes

### Files Permanently Deleted
All template and test HTML files have been **permanently deleted**:
1. ✅ Template pages: about.html, service.html, team.html, testimonial.html, booking.html, contact.html
2. ✅ Test files: test-images.html, generate-test-images.html
3. ✅ Backup files: All inspector-form backup versions
4. ✅ Development files: LOGO_DESIGN_OPTIONS.html, auto-fill-inspector-form.html

**Why deleted booking.html and contact.html?**

- All real contact information is in index.html footer
- No need for separate pages with fake data

**Result:**
- ✅ Clean single-page site architecture
- ✅ No confusion with template dummy data
- ✅ Google will return 404 for old URLs (correct behavior)
- ✅ Faster deployments (minimal files)
- ✅ Easier maintenance (one main page)

### Navigation Structure
All pages now have a clean, simple navigation:
- **Home** → index.html
- **Book Inspection** → booking.html
- **Contact** → contact.html

No more dropdown menus with unused template pages.
