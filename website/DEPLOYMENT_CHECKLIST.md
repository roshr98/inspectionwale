---

### Step 3: Monitor AWS Amplify Build

1. **Open AWS Amplify Console:**
   - Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
   - Select your app
   - Go to "Build history" tab

2. **Watch for new build:**
   - Should start automatically within 1-2 minutes
   - Status: Provision → Build → Deploy
   - Expected duration: 5-10 minutes

3. **Build stages:**
   ```
   ✓ Provision (30 seconds)
   ✓ Build (3-5 minutes)
     - npm install
     - amplify build
     - Lambda function deployment
   ✓ Deploy (1-2 minutes)
   ✓ Verify (30 seconds)
   ```

4. **Check for success:**
   - Green checkmark on latest build
   - No error messages in logs
   - Lambda function updated timestamp

---

### Step 4: Verify Lambda Update

1. **Open AWS Lambda Console:**
   - Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/
   - Find your function: `generate-report`
   - Check "Last modified" timestamp (should be recent)

2. **Verify code:**
   - Click "Code" tab
   - Search for "create_star_shape" (should exist)
   - Search for "COLOR_STAR_GOLD" (should be #fbbf24)
   - Search for "create_two_column_card_table" (should exist)

3. **Check environment:**
   - Runtime: Python 3.11
   - Layers: None required (boto3 and PIL included)
   - Memory: 512 MB (should be sufficient)
   - Timeout: 30 seconds (enough for PDF generation)

---

### Step 5: Test Form Submission

1. **Open inspector form:**
   ```
   https://inspectionwale.com/inspector-form.html
   ```

2. **Login with inspector credentials:**
   - Use valid inspector account
   - Verify login redirects to form

3. **Fill test data:**
   ```
   Registration Number: MH04TEST9999
   Make: Maruti
   Model: Brezza
   Variant: ZXI Plus
   Year: 2020
   Fuel: Petrol
   Color: Arctic White
   Odometer: 35000 km
   Owners: 1st Owner
   
   Owner Name: Test User
   Contact: 9999999999
   Email: test@example.com
   Location: Mumbai, Maharashtra
   
   Highlights: Test vehicle in good condition. All features working.
   ```

4. **Upload test photos:**
   - Start with 3 photos: RC Book, Chassis Plate, Odometer
   - Use small images first (~1MB each)
   - Later test with full 46 photos

5. **Submit form:**
   - Click "Generate Report"
   - Watch for progress indicator
   - Wait for success message

6. **Expected response:**
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "reportId": "INS-1234567890",
     "pdfUrl": "https://inspectionwale-reports.s3.amazonaws.com/reports/INS-1234567890.pdf",
     "message": "Report generated successfully!"
   }
   ```

---

### Step 6: Validate PDF Output

1. **Download PDF:**
   - Click the PDF URL from response
   - Save file locally

2. **Visual inspection checklist:**
   ```
   Page 1:
   □ Light blue background
   □ Header with vibrant blue 3pt border
   □ Vehicle details in 2-column layout
   □ Owner details in 2-column layout
   □ Inspector details in 2-column layout
   □ Key highlights section
   □ Detailed notes sections (if provided)
   □ Dark gray labels, dark black values
   □ Square corners
   □ No border lines between rows
   □ Footer with colorful icons (red, green, blue)
   
   Page 2:
   □ Light blue background (IMPORTANT!)
   □ Overall ratings with golden stars
   □ Stars are actual shapes, not Unicode
   □ Rating text shows "(4.0/5)" format
   □ All 6 categories present
   □ Footer with colorful icons
   
   Page 3+ (if photos uploaded):
   □ Light blue background
   □ Photos in 3-column grid
   □ Captions below each photo
   □ Square corners on photo cards
   □ Footer with colorful icons
   ```

3. **Zoom in on details:**
   - Footer icons should be colorful shapes
   - Stars should be smooth golden polygons
   - Text should be dark black, clearly readable
   - No text wrapping or overlapping
   - Blue accent bars visible on section headers

4. **Compare with sample:**
   - Open `SAMPLE_PROFESSIONAL_V2.pdf`
   - Compare side-by-side with test PDF
   - Should look identical in design

---

### Step 7: Full Photo Test

1. **Upload all 46 photos:**
   - Use the complete form with all photo fields
   - Test with real phone camera images (8-12MB each)
   - Verify compression works (check CloudWatch logs)

2. **Check CloudWatch logs:**
   ```
   Go to AWS Lambda → Monitor → View logs in CloudWatch
   
   Look for:
   ✅ "Compressed: 8532KB → 876KB"
   ✅ "Parsed 15 fields, 46 files"
   ✅ "PDF uploaded: https://..."
   ❌ No error messages
   ```

3. **Verify S3 storage:**
   ```
   Go to S3 bucket: inspectionwale-reports
   Check folder: reports/
   
   Verify:
   - PDF file exists (INS-*.pdf)
   - File size reasonable (1-3MB)
   - Can download and open
   ```

4. **Check DynamoDB:**
   ```
   Go to DynamoDB → Tables → InspectionReports
   
   Verify entry:
   - reportId: INS-*
   - registrationNumber: MH04TEST9999
   - ownerName: Test User
   - pdfUrl: Valid S3 URL
   - status: completed
   - createdAt: Recent timestamp
   ```

---

### Step 8: Performance Testing

1. **Measure generation time:**
   - Start timer when clicking "Generate Report"
   - Stop when PDF URL received
   - Expected: 3-5 seconds with 10 photos
   - Expected: 8-12 seconds with 46 photos

2. **Check Lambda duration:**
   - AWS Lambda → Monitor → View metrics
   - Check "Duration" graph
   - Should be under 15 seconds
   - Should be under timeout (30 seconds)

3. **Monitor memory usage:**
   - AWS Lambda → Monitor → View metrics
   - Check "Memory utilization"
   - Should be under 512 MB limit
   - Increase if needed

---

### Step 9: Error Handling Test

1. **Test with missing fields:**
   - Submit form without required fields
   - Should show validation error (client-side)
   - Should not call Lambda

2. **Test with invalid data:**
   - Try invalid registration number
   - Try text in numeric fields
   - Form validation should catch

3. **Test with large files:**
   - Upload 20MB image (if possible)
   - Lambda should compress successfully
   - Check CloudWatch for compression logs

4. **Test network issues:**
   - Submit form, then quickly go offline
   - Should show timeout or network error
   - Should not crash or hang

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Build fails in Amplify
**Check:**
- Build logs in Amplify console
- Syntax errors in Python code
- Missing dependencies in requirements.txt

**Solution:**
- Review error message
- Fix syntax errors
- Ensure requirements.txt has: reportlab>=4.0.7, Pillow>=10.1.0, boto3>=1.34.0

---

### Issue: PDF still shows old design
**Check:**
- Lambda function last modified time
- Code in Lambda console (search for "create_star_shape")
- Amplify build actually deployed

**Solution:**
- Wait for Amplify build to complete (5-10 min)
- Check Lambda function code directly in console
- Manually trigger rebuild if needed

---

### Issue: Form submission fails
**Check:**
- Browser console for JavaScript errors
- Network tab for failed requests
- Lambda URL in form JavaScript

**Solution:**
- Verify Lambda URL hasn't changed
- Check CORS headers in Lambda response
- Ensure S3 bucket permissions correct

---

### Issue: Photos don't compress
**Check:**
- CloudWatch logs for compression errors
- Image format (should be JPG/PNG/HEIC)
- Pillow library installed

**Solution:**
- Check Lambda layer has Pillow
- Review compress_image() function
- Test with smaller images first

---

### Issue: Text overlapping in PDF
**Check:**
- Column widths in create_two_column_card_table()
- Content length (very long values)
- Font sizes

**Solution:**
- Verify 20/30/20/30 distribution
- Check CONTENT_WIDTH calculation
- Test with shorter text first

---

### Issue: Stars still show as squares
**Check:**
- create_star_drawing() function exists
- create_star_shape() generating coordinates
- Drawing added to table correctly

**Solution:**
- Verify Lambda has latest code
- Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- Compare with generate-professional-final.py

---

   cd "c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Inpectionwale\website\amplify\functions\generate-report\src"
   Copy-Item lambda_function_OLD_BACKUP.py lambda_function.py -Force
   ```

2. **Commit rollback:**
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Rollback: Restore previous Lambda design"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Wait for Amplify:**
   - Monitor build (5-10 minutes)
   - Verify old design works
   - Investigate issues before retrying

4. **Debug offline:**
   - Use generate-professional-final.py to test locally
   - Fix issues in test script first
   - Then update Lambda again
