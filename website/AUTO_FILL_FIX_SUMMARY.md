## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Bulletproof Copy Functionality ‚úÖ

Added 3-level fallback system:
1. Try modern `navigator.clipboard.writeText()` API
2. Fallback to `document.execCommand('copy')`  
3. Final fallback: Auto-select text so user just presses Ctrl+C

**Now works on:** HTTP, HTTPS, localhost, all browsers, all security contexts

### Fix 2: Corrected Photo Count ‚úÖ

Updated ALL references: **47 ‚Üí 46**
- Button text: "46 Photos"
- Warning messages: "requires 46 photos"
- Success message: "46/46 photos"
- Instructions: "Select 46+ images"

**Form has 46 REQUIRED photos:**
- 3 Documents (rcBook, chassisPlate, odometer)
- 6 Front Exterior
- 6 Sides  
- 6 Rear
- 9 Interior
- 6 Engine
- 5 Tires
- 5 Undercarriage

## What Was Already Working ‚úÖ

**All text fields ARE in the script and working:**
- ‚úÖ ownerName, ownerContact, ownerEmail
- ‚úÖ make, model, manufactureYear
- ‚úÖ registrationNumber, location
- ‚úÖ All other fields

**If fields appear empty:**
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
- Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify logged in as inspector

## About "51 Photos Generated"

The generator creates extras for optional fields. This is OK!
- Auto-fill uses first 46 matching photos
- Extras are ignored
- No problem if you have more than 46
