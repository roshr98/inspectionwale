## üí∞ Understanding Your Costs

### Current Setup Risk Assessment:

| Service | Free Tier | Your Usage | Risk | Monthly Cost If Exceeded |
|---------|-----------|------------|------|--------------------------|
| **S3 Storage** | 5 GB | ~2-3 GB | ‚ö†Ô∏è MEDIUM | $0.12 per extra GB |
| **Lambda** | 1M requests | ~10k | ‚úÖ LOW | $0.20 per million extra |
| **DynamoDB** | 25 GB | ~0.5 GB | ‚úÖ LOW | $0.25 per extra GB |
| **Amplify** | 15 GB transfer | ~2 GB | ‚úÖ LOW | $0.15 per extra GB |
| **SES (Email)** | 3,000 emails | ~100 | ‚úÖ LOW | $0.10 per 1,000 extra |

### Most Likely to Cost Money:

**üéØ S3 Storage** - Customer listing photos

**Why:** Each customer who lists a car uploads 6 photos (~10 MB total). After 50 listings, you'll exceed 5 GB free tier.

**Solution:** Enable S3 Lifecycle policy to auto-delete photos older than 90 days.

---

## üéØ Simple Decision Chart

| Monthly Cost | What To Do |
|--------------|------------|
| **$0 - $1** | ‚úÖ Nothing! All good. |
| **$1 - $3** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitor weekly, no action needed yet. |
| **$3 - $5** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Check S3 storage, plan cleanup. |
| **$5 - $10** | üö® Delete old files NOW. Review all services. |
| **$10+** | üî¥ URGENT! Something is wrong. Investigate immediately. |

---

## üßπ Cost Cleanup Actions

### When S3 Reaches 4 GB (80% of free tier):

**Action:** Delete old customer listing submissions

```powershell
# See what's using space
aws s3 ls s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/submissions/ --recursive --summarize --human-readable

# Delete specific submission (replace ID)
aws s3 rm s3://inspectionwale-car-listings/submissions/sub_OLD_ID/ --recursive
```

### When S3 Reaches 5 GB (100% of free tier):

**Action:** Enable S3 Lifecycle Policy (Auto-delete after 90 days)

1. Go to: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/inspectionwale-car-listings
2. Click **"Management"** tab
3. Click **"Create lifecycle rule"**
4. Settings:
   ```
   Rule name: Delete old submissions
   Prefix: submissions/
   Expire current versions after: 90 days
   Delete incomplete uploads after: 7 days
   ```
5. Save

**Result:** Old customer listings automatically deleted after 90 days. Saves ~$0.10-0.20/month.

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### If You Get a $20+ Bill Unexpectedly:

**Step 1: STOP THE BLEEDING (5 minutes)**

1. Login as root ‚Üí Billing Dashboard
2. Check **"Bills"** page ‚Üí See which service costs most
3. If S3:
   - Go to S3 console
   - Check bucket size
   - Enable "Block all public access" if needed
4. If Lambda:
   - Go to Lambda console
   - Set "Reserved concurrency" to 0 (disables function temporarily)
   - Check CloudWatch Logs for errors

**Step 2: INVESTIGATE (10 minutes)**

1. Check CloudWatch Logs for errors:
   ```powershell
   aws logs tail /aws/lambda/customerListings --follow --since 1h
   ```

2. Look for:
   - Infinite loops
   - Repeated error messages
   - Unusual traffic patterns
   - DDoS or bot attacks

**Step 3: CONTACT AWS SUPPORT**

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/
2. Click "Create case"
3. Select "Account and billing support"
4. Explain the situation (errors, bugs, or attacks often get credited back)

**Example message:**
> "I noticed unexpectedly high charges of $20 on my account. After investigation, I found [Lambda function stuck in loop / S3 receiving unusual traffic / etc]. I have now [disabled the function / blocked access / etc]. Can you please review this case and consider a billing adjustment as this was due to [error/misconfiguration]?"

AWS often credits back charges due to errors or attacks!

## üìä Expected Costs (Realistic Estimate)

### Current Usage (October 2025):

**Services within free tier ($ 0/month):**
- ‚úÖ Lambda: ~10,000 requests (1% of free tier)
- ‚úÖ DynamoDB: ~500 MB storage (2% of free tier)
- ‚úÖ Amplify: ~2 GB transfer (13% of free tier)
- ‚úÖ SES: ~100 emails (3% of free tier)
- ‚úÖ CloudFront: ~5 GB transfer (0.5% of free tier)

**Services approaching limits (monitor):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è S3: ~2-3 GB storage (60% of free tier)

### 3-Month Forecast:

**Best case (light usage):**
- Month 1-3: $0/month (all within free tier)

**Likely case (moderate usage):**
- Month 1: $0
- Month 2: $0.50 (S3 exceeds free tier slightly)
- Month 3: $1.00 (50+ customer listings)

**Worst case (heavy usage):**
- Month 1: $2.00
- Month 2: $4.00  
- Month 3: $6.00

**Recommendation:** Keep S3 storage under 5 GB by deleting old listings after 90 days. This keeps you at $0-1/month.
