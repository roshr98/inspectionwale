# Image Compression Testing Guide

## 1. Test Image Compression (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
- Check AWS Amplify Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
- Wait for build to complete (status: "Deployed")
- Should take 2-3 minutes from push

### Step 2: Test Photo Upload
1. Open: https://www.inspectionwale.com
2. Click "List Your Car"
3. Fill in car details (make, model, year, etc.)
4. Take/select 6 high-resolution photos from phone (3-5 MB each)
5. Upload each photo and watch the preview:
   - Image should fade slightly (opacity 0.5) during compression
   - Image should return to full opacity after 1-3 seconds
   - Preview should display immediately

### Step 3: Check Network Tab
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Filter by "Img" or "All"
4. Upload a large photo (e.g., 4 MB)
5. Look for the PUT request to S3
6. Check the request size:
   - **Before**: 4 MB
   - **After**: ~500-800 KB
   - **Reduction**: 70-85%

### Step 4: Verify Visual Quality
1. After submission, view the listing
2. Check that images look sharp and clear
3. No visible pixelation or blur
4. Colors should look natural

## 2. Test Lazy Loading (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Check Initial Load
1. Open: https://www.inspectionwale.com
2. Open Network tab in DevTools
3. Reload page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check images loaded:
   - Only images in viewport should load immediately
   - Images below fold should NOT load yet
   - Total page weight should be 50-70% smaller

### Step 2: Test Scroll Loading
1. Slowly scroll down the page
2. Watch Network tab
3. Images should load as you scroll
4. Lazy loading indicator: "img" requests appear as you scroll

## 3. Performance Testing (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Lighthouse Audit
1. Open: https://www.inspectionwale.com
2. Open DevTools (F12)
3. Go to "Lighthouse" tab
4. Select "Performance" only
5. Click "Analyze page load"
6. Wait for results

**Expected Improvements**:
- **Performance Score**: 80+ (was 50-60)
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: < 2.5s (was 4-6s)
- **Total Blocking Time**: < 200ms
- **Speed Index**: < 3.0s (was 5-7s)

### Step 2: Compare Before/After
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Page Weight | 15-25 MB | 5-8 MB | 60-70% |
| LCP | 4-6s | 2-3s | 50% faster |
| Images Loaded | All | Viewport only | 70% fewer |
| Upload Time | 20-30s | 5-8s | 75% faster |

## 4. Mobile Testing (3 minutes)

### Step 1: Test on Phone
1. Open phone browser
2. Go to: https://www.inspectionwale.com
3. Test scrolling (should be smooth, no lag)
4. Test uploading photos from camera
5. Verify compression works on mobile

### Step 2: Mobile Network Performance
1. Use Chrome DevTools Device Emulation
2. Set throttling to "Slow 3G"
3. Reload page
4. Check load time:
   - Should be < 10s even on slow connection
   - Images should load progressively

## 5. S3 Verification (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Check S3 Bucket
1. Go to S3 Console: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/
2. Open bucket: `inspectionwale-car-listings`
3. Navigate to: `submissions/[your-submission-id]/`
4. Check file sizes:
   - **Before**: 3-5 MB per photo
   - **After**: 400-800 KB per photo
   - **Reduction**: 70-85%

### Step 2: Verify Public Access
1. Click on any uploaded image
2. Copy "Object URL"
3. Open in new browser tab (incognito mode)
4. Image should load without "Access Denied"

---

## 6. Error Testing (2 minutes)

### Test 1: Very Small Image
- Upload a tiny image (< 500 KB, e.g., 200 KB)
- Should skip compression
- Should upload instantly
- Should display correctly

### Test 2: Already Optimized Image
- Upload a compressed JPEG (600 KB)
- Should skip or minimally compress
- Should not increase file size
- Should preserve quality

### Test 3: Large Image
- Upload a huge image (8-12 MP, 5-8 MB)
- Should compress to ~600-800 KB
- Should take 2-3 seconds
- Should look great despite reduction
