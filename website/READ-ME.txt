  Integration notes for InspectionWale
  -----------------------------------
  This copy of the CarServ template has been lightly branded for InspectionWale and wired to the local API endpoint /api/quote.
  If you want me to integrate InspectionWale fully into the template and host it under the same app, I can do that.

  Inputs I need from you to complete a full integration:
   - Confirm API base URL (if your backend will be hosted at a separate URL) or confirm that /api/quote on this server should be used.
   - The email address you want to use as SES sender (e.g. hello@inspectionwale.com) and whether SES is available in your AWS account.
   - (Optional) Google Places API key & Place ID if you want to integrate live reviews into the template.
   - Any branding assets (final logo PNG, preferred hero banner if different from /Images/Banner.jpeg).

  How to preview locally
  ----------------------
