# üìä Google Analytics Migration Guide: WhizzCheck ‚Üí InspectionWale

## Overview
You're migrating from `whizzcheck.com` to `inspectionwale.com` using the same Google account (prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com). This guide ensures a smooth transition without losing historical data.

---

## üéØ Two Approaches

### Approach 1: Rename Existing Property (Recommended) ‚≠ê
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Keeps all historical data
- ‚úÖ Preserves existing tracking setup
- ‚úÖ Same Measurement ID works for both sites
- ‚úÖ Easy to compare WhizzCheck vs InspectionWale performance
- ‚úÖ No cost increase

**Cons:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed data if both sites are active (can be filtered)

**Best for:** You want to see historical trends and compare performance

---

### Approach 2: Create Separate Property
**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Clean separation of data
- ‚úÖ Easier reporting per site
- ‚úÖ Different team access if needed

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Loses historical context
- ‚ùå Can't compare trends easily
- ‚ùå More complex setup

**Best for:** You're completely shutting down WhizzCheck

---

## üìã Approach 1: Rename & Expand (Recommended)

### Step 1: Login to Google Analytics
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Login with: **prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com**
3. You should see your existing account and property

### Step 2: Find Your Current Setup
1. Look at top-left corner - you'll see:
   - **Account name** (e.g., "WhizzCheck Account")
   - **Property name** (e.g., "WhizzCheck Website")
2. Click the property dropdown to confirm which one you're using

### Step 3: Rename Property
1. Click **Admin** (gear icon, bottom-left)
2. You'll see three columns: Account / Property / View (or Data Stream)
3. Under **Property** column:
   - Click "Property settings"
4. Update fields:
   ```
   Property name: WhizzCheck & InspectionWale
   (or just "InspectionWale" if WhizzCheck is shutting down)
   
   Industry category: Automotive
   Reporting time zone: (GMT+05:30) India Standard Time
   Currency: INR - Indian Rupee
   ```
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Update Data Stream
1. Still in **Admin** ‚Üí Under **Property** column
2. Click "Data streams"
3. You'll see your existing web data stream (likely showing whizzcheck.com)
4. Click on the stream name
5. Update:
   ```
   Stream name: InspectionWale Website
   Enhanced measurement: ON (toggle all options for better tracking)
   ```
6. Scroll down to "Configure tag settings"
7. Add cross-domain measurement if needed

### Step 5: Add InspectionWale Domain
**There are two ways to handle this:**

#### Option A: Same Measurement ID for Both Sites (Easiest)
1. Keep the existing Measurement ID
2. Use it on BOTH whizzcheck.com AND inspectionwale.com
3. GA4 will automatically track them separately by hostname
4. You can filter reports by domain

**In your reports, filter like this:**
- Page location ‚Üí Contains `inspectionwale.com` (new site)
- Page location ‚Üí Contains `whizzcheck.com` (old site)

#### Option B: Create Second Data Stream (Separate Tracking)
1. In "Data streams" page ‚Üí Click "Add stream"
2. Select "Web"
3. Enter:
   ```
   Website URL: https://www.inspectionwale.com
   Stream name: InspectionWale Website
   ```
4. Click "Create stream"
5. You'll get a NEW Measurement ID (e.g., G-XYZ456789)
6. Use this ID only on inspectionwale.com
7. Keep old ID on whizzcheck.com

**Recommendation:** Use Option A (same ID) for first 2-3 months to compare traffic, then split if needed.

### Step 6: Get Your Measurement ID
1. In "Data streams" page
2. Click on your stream
3. Top-right corner, you'll see:
   ```
   Measurement ID: G-XXXXXXXXXX
   ```
4. **Copy this ID** - Example: `G-1A2B3C4D5E`
5. Keep this handy for the next step

### Step 7: Update InspectionWale Website Code
**Open index.html:**
```powershell
cd "c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Inpectionwale\website"
notepad index.html
```

**Find and Replace (around line 48-60):**
```html
<!-- OLD (placeholder): -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX', {

<!-- NEW (your actual ID): -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-1A2B3C4D5E"></script>
<script>
  gtag('config', 'G-1A2B3C4D5E', {
```

**Replace in TWO places:**
1. Line ~48: In the `src=` attribute
2. Line ~54: In the `gtag('config', ...)` call

**Save the file.**

### Step 8: Commit and Deploy
```powershell
# Make sure you're in the website directory
cd "c:\Users\Administrator\Documents\Inpectionwale\website"

# Check what changed
git diff index.html

# Should show your Measurement ID replacements
# If it looks good, commit:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add Google Analytics tracking with Measurement ID"
git push origin main
```

**Wait 2-3 minutes** for AWS Amplify to auto-deploy.

### Step 9: Verify It's Working
**Test 1: Check Network Requests**
1. Open: https://www.inspectionwale.com
2. Press F12 (open DevTools)
3. Go to "Network" tab
4. Reload page (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard reload)
5. In filter box, type: `google`
6. You should see:
   - `gtag/js?id=G-YOUR_ID` ‚úÖ
   - `g/collect` (multiple requests) ‚úÖ
7. Click on `g/collect` ‚Üí Preview tab
8. You should see your Measurement ID in the request

**Test 2: Check Real-Time Reports**
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Select your property (now named "InspectionWale" or "WhizzCheck & InspectionWale")
3. Left sidebar ‚Üí Reports ‚Üí **Realtime**
4. Keep this tab open
5. In another tab, open: https://www.inspectionwale.com
6. Browse around:
   - Click on listings
   - Click "List Your Car"
   - View different pages
7. Go back to GA4 Realtime tab
8. Within 30-60 seconds, you should see:
   ```
   Users by the minute: 1 user (that's you!)
   Event count by Event name: view_listing, page_view, etc.
   Users by Page title: InspectionWale pages
   ```
9. If you see this ‚Üí **SUCCESS!** ‚úÖ

**Test 3: Check Custom Events**
1. On your website, click on a car listing card
2. In GA4 Realtime ‚Üí Events
3. You should see: `view_listing` event
4. Click on it to see parameters:
   - `car_make`: Maruti
   - `car_model`: Brezza
   - `listing_id`: abc123
5. If you see these ‚Üí Custom tracking working! ‚úÖ

### Step 10: Update WhizzCheck (if still active)
**If WhizzCheck.com is still running:**

1. Update whizzcheck.com with the SAME Measurement ID
2. Both sites will report to same property
3. GA4 automatically separates by hostname

**To filter data in reports:**
```
InspectionWale traffic:
- Add filter: Page location ‚Üí Contains ‚Üí inspectionwale.com

WhizzCheck traffic:
- Add filter: Page location ‚Üí Contains ‚Üí whizzcheck.com
```

**To see comparison:**
```
1. Reports ‚Üí Engagement ‚Üí Pages and screens
2. Add secondary dimension: "Hostname"
3. You'll see traffic split by domain
```

## üìã Approach 2: Create New Property (Alternative)

### If You Want Completely Separate Tracking:

**Step 1: Create New Property**
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Login with prasad.devadiga333@gmail.com
3. Admin ‚Üí Account column ‚Üí Click "Create Property"

1. Select platform: **Web**
2. Enter:
   ```
   Website URL: https://www.inspectionwale.com
   Stream name: InspectionWale Website
   Enhanced measurement: ON
   ```
3. Click "Create stream"
4. Copy the NEW Measurement ID

**Step 3: Update Website**
- Follow Step 7-9 from Approach 1 above
- Use the NEW Measurement ID

**Step 4: Keep WhizzCheck Separate**
- WhizzCheck continues using old Measurement ID
- InspectionWale uses new Measurement ID
- Completely independent reporting

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Not Tracking in GA4"
**Symptoms:** No data in Realtime report, no requests in Network tab

**Solutions:**
1. Check Measurement ID is correct (no typos)
2. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. Disable ad blocker
4. Check Content Security Policy (CSP) allows Google domains
5. Wait 5-10 minutes (GA4 can have delay)

4. Check custom event code isn't in a loop

### Issue 4: "Can't Separate WhizzCheck and InspectionWale Data"
**Symptoms:** All traffic mixed together

**Solutions:**
1. Use "Hostname" dimension in reports
2. Create custom filter: Page location ‚Üí Contains ‚Üí inspectionwale.com
